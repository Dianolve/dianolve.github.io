Cops and Robbers - How to Play:
There are 6 junkrats (robbers) and 3 reins (Cops). 
The junkrats aim is to survive the full 10 minutes without all being jailed. 
The reinhardts aim is to capture and jail all of the junkrats.
When a junkrat is hit by a reinhardt the reinhardt "picks up" the junkrat and takes him back to the jail (press F on the circle in front of the jail to do so). 
During this time the junkrat will see a camera view of right outside the jail. 
The reinhardts cannot pick up more than one junkrat at a time and must put one in the jail before picking up another. 
As a junkrat you can free your team mates if you go to the circle and hold F for ~3 seconds. 
Special Rules: 
if a junkrat punches a reinhardt who is taking one of their team mates to the jail that team mate is freed and respawns somewhere on the map. 
You cannot use your primary fire, as a junkrat, while walking around normally howver in jail you can use it (shoot through the bars) to kill a reinhardt, which frees your ally.
